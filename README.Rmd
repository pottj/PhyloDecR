# PhyloDecR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of PhyloDecR is to check sets of taxon sets for phylogenetic decisiveness in R.

## Installation

You can install the released version of PhyloDecR from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("PhyloDecR")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pottNeJa/PhyloDecR")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#library(PhyloDecR)
## basic example code
```

Will be done later, when all functions are included :)
